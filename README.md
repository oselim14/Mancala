## Getting Started

The game of mancala works in a counter clockwise rotation. Player one begins by picking up all of the stones of any of the 6 pockets in front of them (legal moves are shown with a highlighted pocket). They then move counterclockwise and drop one stone in each pocket including their mancala until they have no more stones. If their final stone was dropped in their mancala, their turn continues and they may select another pocket. When moving around the board, players will drop stones into their mancala(on their right hand side of the board), but will skip the other players mancala(on their left side of the board). The game continues until all the pockets on one side of the board are empty. The winner is then determined by whichever player has more stones. 

## Next Steps:
- Update player 2 to be a computer selecting a randomly generated pocket. 
- Add mancala stones to the board along with the numbers.
